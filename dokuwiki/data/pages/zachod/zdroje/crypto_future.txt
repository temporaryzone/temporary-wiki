====== Crypto future 2016-2022 ======
by Pavel Lupták


In The Year 2016…

	* The stable version of OpenBazaar (the concept of decentralized free cryptomarkets) with TOR/P2P will be released

	* The first physical bitcoin based anonymous mail boxes (in Parallel Polis and other places)

	* The prohibition of anonymous transactions (because of “threat of criminals and terrorists”) for legal purposes, the sender and recipient have to always be identified

	* The first open-source implementation of Uber-like taxi sharing service and Airbnb-like sharing service will be released — in Uber/Airbnb regulated countries, people will start to use cryptoanarchistic version of Uber/Airbnb with anonymous cryptocurrencies through TOR/i2p (Check Arcade.city project!)

	* The rise of financial offshore based on cryptocurrencies (thanks to drastic regulation of the traditional (fiat) offshore)

In The Year 2017…

	* CALEA II will be approved (mandatory government backdoors in all crypto solutions offered in the U.S.), similar legislation will be approved in other developed countries

	* Threat of Cyberterrorism will be highly overestimated

	* Anonymous cash will be prohibited in most Western countries — the rise of street racketeers offering different cryptocurrencies

	* Cryptomarkets will go mobile — UX/Usability of cryptomarkets will be significantly improved, most people can afford to visit and use decentralized cryptomarkets without technical knowledge

	* The first proved documented assassination of a politician using the concept of anonymous collaborative murder (Jim Bell’s “Assassination politics”) — politicians will start to fear… being a politician is more risky than ever before.

	* Increased criminalization of cryptomarket’s users

In The Year 2018…

	* Availability of anti-government insurance (in case of cryptomarkets use, drug possession, bypassing surveillance laws, using cash) thanks to decentralized and anonymous insurance companies

	* Providers of TOR exit nodes and OpenBazaar nodes will be cruelly criminalized

	* Massive increase of decentralized Internet solutions (funkfeuer, Serval Mesh, …) that will be out of government control…

	* Many TOR/OpenBazaar nodes will be placed in the air (anonymous still-flying drones) or in still poor countries with old-school legislation

In The Year 2019…

	* Universal sharing economy mobile application allowing anyone to provide his/her services to anyone without government control/taxation will be available

	* This will be fully decentralized solution impossible to shut down by the government (like Bitcoin) with use of anonymous cryptocurrencies

	* First anonymous crowd-sourced drone strikes

	* The government will start to have a difficult times (see Paul Rosenberg’s book — A Lodging of Wayfaring Men)… 

In The Year 2020…

	* The governments will radically change the taxation model — no taxation for virtual/Internet services, high taxation for real-world properties and real-world businesses some countries will switch to head-tax

	* Massive people immigration to sea-steading islands/free ancap-based countries

In The Year 2021…

	* The existing financial system will break/collapse

	* The new financial 100% controlled system will be introduced with fear after breakdown of the existing system

	* Seasteading-based free countries will be invaded by the U.S./U.K./Western countries

	* Strong separation of the real world and cryptoanarchistic world (“the second realm”) average people will switch to this world after they see cryptoanarchy works…

In The Year 2022…

	* The current social system will collapse, the rise of virtual states with social/protection benefits

	* Despite the fact virtual states (like Bitnation) are still not legitimized by the countries/governments, they start to be commercially attractive and offer many advantages/citizenship protections replacing the current governments…
