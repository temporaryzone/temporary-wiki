Why terrorists don't target politicians 

Presidents,Parliamentarians and Prime Ministers appear before large crowds on a regular basis. One would think that one of these HUNDREDS of "suicide bombers" would have bum-rushed a politician while detonating a 'suicide belt' or fired a weapon but they haven't even attempted! Why is that? Because "Suicidal Muslim Terrorists" DO NOT EXIST! 
The manufactured monster of "Islamic Terror" is the stuff of fables -- a useful Orwellian tool to achieve various geo-strategic and domestic ends. "Islamic Terror" consists solely of clandestine Intelligence operatives (dressed in laughable Ninja pajamas and orange jumpsuits) and well paid mercenaries controlled by the very same shadow government whose wholly-owned politicians are safe from "suicide assassins" who only kill ordinary people.And, of course, the CIA-Mossad news-media is 100% "in on it" as well. We're being played people. Wake up.
