frankly i would just create an array in site.yaml
with taxonomy->description mappings
then you can look up your description for the taxonomy that way
somehting like:

tax_descriptions:
  author: Authors are the people that write this stuff
  category: Categories control the top-level content buckets

then you could just do something like:

{{ site.tax_descriptions.author }}

or if that was a dynamic variable...

{{ attribute(site.tax_descriptions, taxonomy_var) }}

or you could use the language filesâ€¦.
with similar approach
