Which CDN to use for renting webfonts (data saas)?

I want to create little service for renting webfonts. I got designer friends who made some typefaces and i am looking for some efficient way how to rent them (similar to typekit).
My idea is that the users pay some fixed amount for the license of the font plus they will pay for bandwidth depending on the usage.
This is small thing that might grow but we definetly wont host the fonts ourselves.
So my idea is to use CDN. Webfonts are just simple static files. But i need CDN that will allow me to separate each client so i can bill them separately for their usage. I would gladly offload this completely on the cdn (including billing of the bandwidth) but i need to stay in control of the files. 
Will any CDN like maxCDN or cachefly with their API do?
thanks
