Dear New Client,
Please keep in mind that your domain name will not be visible on the internet for between 24 and 72 hours. This process is called Propagation. Until your domain has Propagated your website and email will not function, we have provided a temporary url which you may use to view your website and upload files in the meantime.
IMPORTANT: Make sure you upload your files to the PUBLIC_HTML or www directory on the server otherwise they will not be visible on the internet. Also, please be sure that your homepage is saved as an "index" file e.g., index.htm, index.html*, etc. We suggest you download FileZilla from http://filezilla-project.org/ if you do not already have an ftp client. Download page: https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?show_all=1 
   *note we place an example "index.html" you should remove/overwrite this file either by FTP or file manager.   To use a secure way to transfer your files over FTP please use FTPS (note that this is different from SFTP) if you use Filezilla please select as protocol: FTP and as Encryption: Explicit FTP over TLS.
Below are your account details, you will need your username and password to access ftp and your control panel.

Corporate users behind a proxy/firewall
Many customers which are behind corporate firewalls are not able to connect to our cPanel or Webmail due to restrictive settings on the firewall their company is using. Solution would be either open the ports, or use the following access:
cPanel: http://cpanel.temporary.zone Webmail: http://webmail.temporary.zone Webdisk: http://webdisk.temporary.zone WHM: http://whm.temporary.zone (not available on normal hosting packages)
Note that the above will only work when the DNS is managed by 040 Hosting, please contact support for more details if needed.
